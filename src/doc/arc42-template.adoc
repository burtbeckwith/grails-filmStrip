|ID    |State  | Description
|FS-1  |closed | asciidoc: how to reference Requirements the right way. something like <<R2>>
|FS-2  |closed | a '-' in a test or report label is a problem because it is also used as
                 delimiter in the reports labels
|FS-3  |started| need an example report. let's base it on the petclinic and deploy on 
                 github. has to be referenced from this documentations appendix
|FS-4  |open   | add some profile "fotos" to each persona. There is this cool avatar genrator which might be used.
|FS-5  |closed | we now have a quite customized gebConfig.groovy. The plugin has to make sure that it is used...
|FS-6  |open   | packages are currently not supported => document this
|FS-7  |open   | End-Reports are currently not shown. The intended behaviour is that they are only not shown 
                 when the content is the same as of the report before. This can be achieved by comparing the reported HTML

== Open Issues

In order to work offline on this project, all open issues are collected in this
document. But if you want to open a new issue, just add it to the github issues 
located at https://github.com/rdmueller/grails-filmStrip/issues . The ultimate
goal is to sync these offline issues with the github ones. An intermediate goal
would be to export the github issues to this document in order to maintain the
issues online but always have an offline copy.

|ID    |State  | Description
|FS-1  |closed | asciidoc: how to reference Requirements the right way. something like <<R2>>
|FS-2  |closed | a '-' in a test or report label is a problem because it is also used as
                 delimiter in the reports labels
|FS-3  |started| need an example report. let's base it on the petclinic and deploy on 
                 github. has to be referenced from this documentations appendix
|FS-4  |open   | add some profile "fotos" to each persona. There is this cool 
                 avatar genrator which might be used.
|FS-5  |closed | we now have a quite customized gebConfig.groovy. The plugin has 
                 to make sure that it is used...
|FS-6  |open   | packages are currently not supported => document this
|FS-7  |open   | End-Reports are currently not shown. The intended behaviour is 
                 that they are only not shown when the content is the same as of 
                 the report before. This can be achieved by comparing the reported HTML 
|FS-8  |open   | Replace monkey patch with a better solution. Solution proposed 
                 by Marcin Erdmann: extend GebReportingSpec.
|FS-9  |open   | Want to have a button with which I can flip through all screens
|FS-10 |open   | It would be nice to find an automated way to add the
                 +FileStripReportingListener+ to the +gebConfig+
|FS-11 |open   | finish documentation
|FS-12 |open   | compare created arc42 documentation with docs of the 10 best plugins
|FS-13 |open   | create the same functionality as gradle project, later plugin
|FS-14 |open   | see FS-6 : Packages are important, so implement them
